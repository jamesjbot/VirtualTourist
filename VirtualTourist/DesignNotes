When prefetch is on
I'm using DispatchQueue.main.async to fire off
An asynchronous image download

Then

In the background context I'm synchrnously
converting the downloaded image to data format
And then saving it to the background context,
which will also push up to the mainContext.'

The photoAlbum's fetched results controller observes changes on the mainContext.
Then updates the collection accordingly.'
